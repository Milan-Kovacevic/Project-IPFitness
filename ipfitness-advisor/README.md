# Ip Fitness - Consultant/Advisor Application
Application is built using the MVC M2 architecture, leveraging the power of JSP and Servlet technology. With a clear separation of concerns, the Model layer handles the business logic and data management, the View layer, composed of JSP files, presents the user interface, and the Controller layer, implemented through Servlets, orchestrates the interaction between the Model and View. 

### Project Application Requirement
> Consultation Application

*To access the consultation application, you need to have an account opened by the administrator through the administrative part of the application. 
This account is different from the accounts for the administrative or fitness online application. If the login is successful, a page opens where the advisor can view all received messages. The table displays all unread messages, and opening one changes its status to read. Replies to messages are sent via email. In addition to text, the advisor should be able to send a document with additional descriptions or an image. The advisor can search all messages by content.
Implement the consultation application using JSP.*
