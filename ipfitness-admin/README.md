# Ip Fitness - Administrator Application
Application is built using the MVC M2 architecture, leveraging the power of JSP and Servlet technology. With a clear separation of concerns, the Model layer handles the business logic and data management, the View layer, composed of JSP files, presents the user interface, and the Controller layer, implemented through Servlets, orchestrates the interaction between the Model and View. 

### Project Application Requirement
> Administrator Application

*To access the administrator application, you need to have an account created directly in the database (name, surname, username, password). 
On the homepage, there is a login form. If the login is successful, a page opens with a menu containing options:*
- *Categories: allows management of data (CRUD) about categories and specific categories of fitness programs.*
- *Users: allows management of data (CRUD) about users of the fitness online application.*
- *Statistics: allows viewing logs of the fitness backend application.*

*The implementation of the administrator application must be done using JSP M2. The use of ready-made libraries for user interface design is allowed.*
